# Algorithms-for-DNA-Sequencing

This course is hold on Coursera by John Hopkins Univeritsy

Course information:
"We will learn computational methods -- algorithms and data structures -- for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We will learn a little about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used.  We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets."

Here are the solutions I wrote for the course homework.

Week 1: DNA sequencing, strings and matching  
Week 2: Preprocessing, indexing and approximate matching  
Week 3: Edit distance, assembly, overlaps  
Week 4: Algorithms for assembly
